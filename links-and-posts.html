<h3 id="how-i-built-this-site">How I Built This Site</h3>

<p>First of all, this site will always be a work in progress, as I continue to learn more about programming. However, there are a few resources that I looked to at the beginning. Here they are, in no particular order:</p>

          <ul class="developer-resources">

            <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/">Rob Percival's Udemy Course</a> - This course taught me the basics about bootstrap and where to find lots of other resources.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS</a> - This course taught me the basics about HTML and CSS, which is foundational for any understanding of programming. It also teaches you some of the basics about how the tools you'll need to use throughout the process of building a website.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Coursera's Python for Everybody course</a> - This course goes through a more complex language, python, but explains a lot about how to run programs on your computer. It's not necessary to make a website, but you'll learn a ton</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools website</a> - This website contains more documentation about programming than you'll need to get a website going, but it's a great resource if you forget how to do anything.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.benbalter.com/">Ben Balter's website</a> - Ben's put together a great personal website that is way more complicated than what I've been able to put together. However, it makes use of bootstrap and is a great resource if you want to view the source and see how he put together some of the pages and posts.</li>
